    <h2>Understanding Depression</h2><p>Depression is a common and serious mental health condition that affects how you feel, think, and handle daily activities. It's more than just feeling sad or going through a rough patch; it's a persistent condition that requires understanding and treatment.</p>

    <h3>What Is Depression?</h3>
    <p>Depression, or major depressive disorder, is characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest or pleasure in activities. It can interfere with daily functioning and lead to various emotional and physical problems.</p>

    <h3>Symptoms of Depression</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Persistent sad, anxious, or "empty" mood</li>
      <li>Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities</li>
      <li>Feelings of hopelessness or pessimism</li>
      <li>Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness</li>
      <li>Decreased energy or fatigue</li>
      <li>Difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions</li>
      <li>Insomnia or oversleeping</li>
      <li>Appetite or weight changes</li>
      <li>Thoughts of death or suicide</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Causes and Risk Factors</h3><p>Depression can result from a combination of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors. Risk factors include a family history of depression, major life changes, trauma, stress, and certain physical illnesses or medications.</p>

    <h3>Treatment and Coping Strategies</h3>
    <p>Depression is treatable, and early intervention is key. Common treatments include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Psychotherapy:</strong> Talking with a mental health professional can help address the underlying causes of depression and develop coping strategies.</li>
      <li><strong>Medication:</strong> Antidepressants can help adjust the brain's chemical balance.</li>
      <li><strong>Lifestyle changes:</strong> Regular exercise, a healthy diet, and adequate sleep can improve symptoms.</li>
      <li><strong>Support groups:</strong> Connecting with others facing similar challenges can provide comfort and understanding.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It's essential to seek help if you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms of depression. Support is available, and recovery is possible.</p>

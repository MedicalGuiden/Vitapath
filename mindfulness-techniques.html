    <h2>Practical Techniques for Everyday Mindfulness</h2>
    <p>
      Mindfulness is the act of being consciously present in the moment without judgment. It helps reduce stress, improve focus, and promote mental clarity.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Breathing Meditation</h3>
    <p>
      Sit quietly, focus on your breath, and gently bring your mind back when it wanders. This simple technique increases awareness and relaxation.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Body Scan</h3>
    <p>
      Lie down or sit comfortably. Slowly scan through your body, from head to toe, noting tension or discomfort without trying to fix it.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Mindful Walking</h3><p>
      Pay attention to each step, the feeling of your feet touching the ground, your breathing, and the rhythm of your body as you walk.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Mindful Eating</h3>
    <p>
      Focus on each bite â€” taste, texture, and smell. Avoid distractions and eat slowly to improve digestion and food awareness.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Daily Integration</h3>
    <p>
      Practice mindfulness while brushing your teeth, doing dishes, or during short breaks. Small moments add up to big benefits.
    </p>

    <p>
      With consistency, mindfulness can become a powerful tool for enhancing mental and emotional well-being in your everyday life.

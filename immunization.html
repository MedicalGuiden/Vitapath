    <h2>Why Childhood Immunization Matters</h2>
    <p>Vaccination, also known as immunization, is one of the most effective ways to protect children from life-threatening diseases. It involves giving a child a small, safe amount of a weakened or inactive form of a virus or bacteria, which helps their immune system recognize and fight the disease in the future.</p>

    <h3>Why Is It Important?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Prevents Serious Illness</strong>: Protects against deadly diseases like measles, polio, TB, and hepatitis.</li><li><strong>Builds Immunity Early</strong>: The earlier a child is vaccinated, the sooner they are protected.</li>
      <li><strong>Protects Others</strong>: Helps create community immunity (herd immunity).</li>
      <li><strong>Cost-Effective</strong>: Preventing is cheaper than treating diseases.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>When Should a Child Be Vaccinated?</h3>
    <p>Vaccines are given according to a schedule starting at birth:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>At Birth</strong>: BCG, Oral Polio</li>
      <li><strong>2, 4, 6 Months</strong>: DTP, Hepatitis B, Polio, Hib, Rotavirus</li>
      <li><strong>9 Months</strong>: Measles</li>
      <li><strong>18 Months</strong>: Booster doses</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Each country may vary, but the principle is the same: vaccinate early and on time.</p>

    <h3>Final Thought</h3>
    <p>Vaccination is a gift you give your child for a healthier future. Itâ€™s safe, effective, and a shared responsibility.</p>

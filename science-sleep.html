    <h2>The Science of Sleep</h2><p>Sleep is a fundamental biological process that allows your body and mind to recharge, supporting optimal physical and mental performance. The science of sleep explores the different stages of sleep, their functions, and how sleep impacts overall health.</p>

    <h3>Stages of Sleep</h3>
    <p>There are two main types of sleep: Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) and Rapid Eye Movement (REM). NREM includes stages 1 through 3, with stage 3 being deep sleep. REM sleep is when most dreaming occurs and is crucial for brain health and memory consolidation.</p>

    <h3>Circadian Rhythm</h3>
    <p>Your body operates on a 24-hour internal clock known as the circadian rhythm. It influences sleep-wake cycles, hormone release, and metabolism. Exposure to light, especially natural sunlight, helps regulate this rhythm and promotes healthy sleep patterns.</p>

    <h3>Why Sleep Matters</h3>
    <p>Quality sleep plays a critical role in immune function, emotional stability, learning, and recovery. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to cognitive decline, heart disease, weight gain, and mood disorders.</p>

    <h3>Tips for Better Sleep</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Maintain a consistent sleep schedule—even on weekends.</li>
      <li>Create a sleep-friendly environment: dark, quiet, and cool.</li><li>Limit caffeine and screen time before bed.</li>
      <li>Exercise regularly, but not too close to bedtime.</li>
      <li>Avoid heavy meals and alcohol before sleeping.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Understanding the science of sleep empowers you to prioritize rest and build habits that promote deeper, more restorative sleep. It’s not about sleeping longer, but sleeping better.</p>

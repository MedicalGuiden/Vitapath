    <h2>Top 10 Tips for a Healthier Lifestyle Through Nutrition & Fitness</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Start Your Day with a Nutritious Breakfast:</strong>
        Eating a balanced breakfast jumpstarts your metabolism and gives your body essential nutrients to start the day. Include whole grains, fruits, and proteins like eggs or yogurt.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Stay Hydrated:</strong>Water is crucial for every function in the body. Aim for at least 8 glasses a day. Avoid sugary drinks and opt for water, herbal teas, or natural fruit-infused water.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Incorporate More Whole Foods:</strong>
        Whole foods like fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and whole grains provide fiber and essential nutrients your body needs to stay energized and healthy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Reduce Processed Food Intake:</strong>
        Processed foods are often high in sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats. Reducing their intake lowers your risk of chronic diseases and weight gain.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Practice Portion Control:</strong>
        Even healthy foods can contribute to weight gain if consumed in large amounts. Use smaller plates, avoid eating straight from packages, and listen to your hunger signals.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Stay Physically Active:</strong>
        Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise five times a week. Walking, swimming, or home workouts can improve cardiovascular health and mood.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Plan Your Meals:</strong>Meal planning helps you avoid unhealthy last-minute food choices. Prepare grocery lists, cook in batches, and store healthy meals to save time and money.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prioritize Sleep:</strong>
        Good sleep helps regulate hunger hormones, improves mood, and aids muscle recovery. Aim for 7–9 hours of sleep each night.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Set Realistic Goals:</strong>
        Don’t try to change everything at once. Start with small, achievable goals and build healthy habits over time. This approach is more sustainable and motivating.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Stay Consistent:</strong>
        Consistency is the key to success. There will be days you miss a workout or indulge in junk food, but returning to your routine quickly keeps your progress on track.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Building a healthier lifestyle isn’t about perfection—it’s about making better choices each day. Through consistent attention to your nutrition and physical activity, you can transform your energy levels, appearance, and overall well-being.
